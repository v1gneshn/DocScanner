VISI 's an acronym that stands for very-large-scale integration, This
somewhat nebulous term is used to collectively refer to the many ficlds of
Hlectrieal and computer engineering that deal-wvith the analysis and
design of very dense electronic integrated circuits. Although a strict defi-
nition is difficult to come by; one commonly used metric is to say that a
YLSI contains more than a million (105 or so switching devices or logle
gates, Early in the first decade of the 21st century, the actual number of
transistors (the switching devices) has exceeded 100 million (10°) for the
more complex designs on a picce of silicon (a chip), which 's typically
about 1 centimeter on a side.
This book has been written to provide an understanding of the basics
| of digitel VLSI chip design. Emphasis is placed on presenting the details
of translating a system specification to a small piece of silicon, The treat-
ment is very technical with many detalls. Some statements and analyses
will appear immediately obvious, while others may not make sense until
later chapters. This decurs because the fleld of VLSI engineering encom-
passes several distinct “aréas of speciallzation” that mesh together in a
unique manner. The most difficult aspect of learning VLSI is seeing the
common theme that links the areas together. Once this is accomplished,
you are on your way to understanding one of the most fascinating fields of
modern tes.
